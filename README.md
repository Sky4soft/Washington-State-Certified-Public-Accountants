# üìú Washington State Certified Public Accountants Data 

The data in this repository comes from the [Washington State Open Data Portal](https://data.wa.gov/Consumer-Protection/Washington-State-Certified-Public-Accountants/6du3-3h9e/about_data). It provides **detailed records** on Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) licensed in **Washington State**. üèõÔ∏è

## üìå Overview

This project analyzes CPA licensing data in Washington State, focusing on trends, geographic distribution, and status changes over time. With 47,925 records, the dataset provides details on license holders, including their location, license status, and regulatory history. It serves as a resource for regulators, recruiters, and policymakers to track certification patterns and workforce trends. Given the growing demand for CPAs and a nationwide talent shortage, this analysis offers insights into career pathways, retention rates, and regional concentrations of licensed professionals. While the data facilitates credential verification and disciplinary checks, it does not serve as an official endorsement of any individual or firm.

In Washington State (https://acb.wa.gov/), CPA licenses are valid for three years and must be renewed between January 1 and April 30 (https://acb.wa.gov/individual-licensing/renewal) and the fee for renewal is $230. Additionally, CPA mobility allows licensed CPAs to practice in other states or transfer their licenses, which is why the dataset includes WA-licensed CPAs located in various states and countries.

## üîç About the Data

This dataset contains information on **licensed CPAs** in Washington State, including:
- üìõ **Full Name** of the CPA
- üìç **City, State & Country** where they are based
- üî¢ **License Number** for identification
- üìÖ **Original Issue Date & Expiration Dates** of the license
- üìú **License Status** (Active, Lapsed, Expired, and Suspended.)
- üìå **Years of Service** 

## Motivation
This project analyzes CPA licensing data to identify trends, track license activity, and map geographic distributions. By examining licensing dates, status changes, and attrition rates, it provides insights into regulatory compliance, workforce trends, and the impact of economic events on new licenses. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for regulators, professional organizations, and researchers, helping to inform policy decisions, improve licensing processes, and enhance oversight of CPA professionals.

2. By Year: This data presents the yearly trend of CPA licenses issued over time. The numbers fluctuate, indicating variations in new CPA certifications in Washington State. Recent Trends: The number of new licenses has remained relatively stable from 2017 to 2024, with a peak of 1,867 in 2022 and a slight decline in 2023 (1,741) and 2024 (1,794). Impact of Major Events: The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) saw a dip in new licenses (1,452 in 2020), which rebounded in 2022. Declining Numbers Over Time: Compared to earlier years, 2013-2015 had fewer new licenses issued, suggesting a gradual increase in CPA interest in recent years. Future Outlook: The 2025 figure (525) suggests only partial data, but could indicate a slower start for CPA issuances that year.

4. Active CPA License Holders

The Malloy code defines a view named CPA_Active_Status to filter and aggregate CPA license data based on their status. It groups the data by CPA status while renaming the column for better readability, then counts the number of licenses within each status group. The dataset is filtered to include only CPAs actively licensed to practice public accounting, excluding other statuses such as lapsed, retired, or suspended. Additionally, a limit of 400,000 records is set to optimize query performance while processing a large dataset. This code helps summarize and extract insights into the number of actively licensed CPAs.

## Number of active CPAs
The data shows that a total of 24,371 people currently hold an active WA CPA license from 1910 to present. Though these candidates hold the WA CPA license, only 50% are still in WA and the rest are in other States or Countries.

## International Licensure Through Reciprocity: "Mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) between professional accounting associations in the U.S. and six other countries allow accountants who have been certified or chartered in any of those countries to qualify to practice in the U.S. without being completely re-credentialed."

The AICPA has formed mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with nine international accounting bodies, enabling U.S. CPAs to work in these countries with officially recognized credentials.
